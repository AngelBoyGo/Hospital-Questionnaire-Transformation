# Hospital Sandbox Generator

## 🎯 Mission
Convert SRS (Software Requirements Specification) documents into working, isolated sandbox environments where hospitals can safely test their IT transformations.

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development Approach

### Step 1: SRS Document Reader
- **Goal**: Read and understand SRS JSON documents
- **Test First**: Can we parse SRS and extract key requirements?

### Step 2: Environment Parser  
- **Goal**: Convert SRS requirements into infrastructure specifications
- **Test First**: Can we identify what containers/services are needed?

### Step 3: Sandbox Builder
- **Goal**: Create actual isolated environments
- **Test First**: Can we spin up containers with correct configurations?

### Step 4: Testing Interface
- **Goal**: Provide UI/API for hospitals to interact with sandbox
- **Test First**: Can hospitals access and test their workflows?
